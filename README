Requirements
------------

- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

Installation
------------

The running of

	$ ./make host discussemail

builds the static content of the website in the `build/` directory. It is
possible to change the output directory by setting the `BUILD` environment
variable.

The `host` parameter is the domain name of the website.

The `discussemail` parameter is the email the *Discuss* buttons of the website
link to.

Structure
---------

The website structure is composed by the `.md` files in `src/root/`.

Each `.md` file is a page and is translated to HTML using
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Every `.md` file is accompanied by the following files:

- The corresponding `.desc` file contains the description of the page.
- The corresponding `.md.time` file contains the creation timestamp of the page
  on the first line and the last modification timestamp on the second one.
- The corresponding `.title` file contains the title of the page.

Only the `404.md` and `5xx.md` files do not have a `.md.time` file.

The `src/` directory also contains the following files:

- `header.html` — The HTML code to embed before the content generated by the
  `.md` files for each page.
- `fonts.css` — The CSS file containing the @font-face rules.
- `footer.html` — The HTML code to embed after the content generated by the
  `.md` files for each page.
- `icon/*.svg` — The base SVG image of a specific icon variation.
- `robots.txt` — The *robots.txt* file to be copied at root.
- `script.js` — The main JavaScript file.
- `style.css` — The main CSS file.
- `title` — The title of the website.

Additionally, each file in the `public/` directory is copied to the relative
`public/` directory of the build directory.
