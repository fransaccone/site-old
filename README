# Site

The website of Francesco Saccone, available at <https://frasac.com/>.

## Installation

The running of

	$ ./make host sitetitle discussemail

builds the static content of the website in the `build/` directory. It is
possible to change the output directory by setting the `BUILD` environment
variable.

The `host` parameter is the domain name of the website.

The `sitetitle` parameter is the website title.

The `discussemail` parameter is the email the *Discuss* buttons of the website
link to.

## Structure

The website structure is composed by the `.md` files in `src/root/`.

Each `.md` file is a page and is translated to HTML using
[lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/).

Every `.md` file is accompanied by the following files:

- The corresponding `.desc` file contains the description of the page.
- The corresponding `.md.time` file contains the creation timestamp of the page
  on the first line and the last modification timestamp on the second one.
- The corresponding `.title` file contains the title of the page.

Only the `404.md` and `5xx.md` files do not have a `.md.time` file.

The `src/` directory also contains the following files:

- `header.html` --- The HTML code to embed before the content generated by the
  `.md` files for each page.
- `footer.html` --- The HTML code to embed after the content generated by the
  `.md` files for each page.
- `icon/*.svg` --- The base SVG image of a specific icon variation.
- `robots.txt` --- The *robots.txt* file to be copied at root.

Additionally, each file in the `public/` directory is copied to the relative
`public/` directory of the build directory.
